<h2>Here's a time line of Pasteur's life:</h2>
        <li>1822 – Born in Dole, France.</li>
        <li>1857 – Developed the germ theory, showing that microorganisms cause fermentation and disease.</li>
        <li>1862 – Disproved spontaneous generation by showing that microbes come from other microbes.</li>
        <li>1865 – Identified the cause of a disease in silkworms, saving the silk industry.</li>
        <li>1865–1870 – Invented pasteurization, a method to kill bacteria in liquids like milk and wine.</li>
        <li>1879 – Created his first vaccine for chicken cholera, using weakened germs.</li>
        <li>1881 – Developed and tested a vaccine for anthrax on animals.</li>
        <li>1885 – Successfully used a rabies vaccine on a young boy, saving his life.</li>
        <li>1887 – Founded the Pasteur Institute in Paris for medical research.</li>
        <li>1895 – Died in Marnes-la-Coquette, France.</li>
        <p>In summary, Louis Pasteur was a pioneer in microbiology whose discoveries—such as germ theory, pasteurization, and vaccines—revolutionized science and medicine. His work saved lives, improved public health, and continues to impact the world today.</p>
